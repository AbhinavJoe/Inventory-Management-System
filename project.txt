Project: Inventory Management System

Description:
Develop an inventory management system that can be used by businesses to keep track of their product inventory. This project involves creating a database to store information about products, suppliers, and current stock levels.

Key Features:
-Product Information: Store details about each product, including product ID, name, description, price, and quantity in stock.
-Supplier Information: Include a table for supplier details, such as supplier ID, name, contact information, etc.
-Inventory Transactions: Implement a system for tracking inventory transactions, including purchases, sales, and returns. Each transaction should update the stock levels accordingly.
-User Authentication: If applicable, add a user authentication system to control access to the inventory management system.
-Reporting: Create SQL queries and views to generate reports, such as low-stock alerts, top-selling products, or purchase history.

Potential Benefits:
-Efficient Inventory Management: Helps businesses keep track of their inventory in real-time, reducing the chances of overstocking or stockouts.
-Data-Driven Decision Making: Provides insights into product performance, enabling informed decisions on restocking, pricing, and supplier relationships.
-Improved Accuracy: Reduces manual errors associated with traditional paper-based inventory management systems.

Technologies:
-SQL for database design and queries.
-You can use a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

Additional Tips:
-Document your database schema, providing a clear explanation of each table's purpose and relationships.
-Consider creating a simple front-end interface to interact with the database, showcasing your skills in connecting databases with applications.
